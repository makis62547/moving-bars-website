    q1: "WHAT’S INCLUDED IN THE COCKTAIL CATERING PACKAGE?",
    a1: "Mobile bar, staff, ice, glassware, ingredients, decoration, setup and teardown, plus a menu card.",
    q2: "HOW DOES THE COCKTAIL CATERING WORK AT THE EVENT?",
    a2: "We arrive before your guests, set up the bar, quickly coordinate the schedule with you, and then start service. During the event we handle preparation, restocking, and a smooth workflow — and we pack down afterwards as agreed.",
    q3: "WHAT DO YOU NEED ON SITE (SPACE, ACCESS, PARKING)?",
    a3: "Ideally a well-accessible setup area with short distances to the bar location and a loading zone/parking option for unloading. For a relaxed workflow, there should be enough space for the bar and working area (approx. 2 × 2 m per bar).",
    q4: "DO YOU NEED POWER OR WATER?",
    a4: "We need power for the bar lighting and, if required, a blender. A standard 230 V outlet is sufficient. We don’t need a fixed water connection — access to a tap is enough. We’ll coordinate details with you in advance.",
    q5: "DOES COCKTAIL CATERING WORK OUTDOORS — AND WHAT HAPPENS IF IT RAINS?",
    a5: "Outdoors is possible if the bar can be placed in a weather-protected area. In case of rain/wind, we recommend a cover (e.g., a gazebo) or an indoor alternative.",
    q6: "CAN WE ADD MORE DRINKS DURING THE EVENT?",
    a6: "We always bring a small buffer of cocktails/long drinks. If the booked quantity isn’t enough, we can continue mixing upon agreement. We charge €5.40 net per additional cocktail/long drink.",
    q7: "DO YOU OFFER NON-ALCOHOLIC COCKTAILS / MOCKTAILS?",
    a7: "Yes — non-alcoholic cocktails are included in every menu. You can also book fully alcohol-free: choose our “Only Mocktails” menu.",
    q8: "WHAT ARE “COCKTAIL MENUS”?",
    a8: "We offer 10 different cocktail menus curated for different tastes and occasions. You can pick one you like, or create your own menu and tell us your preferences.",
    q9: "ARE THERE TRAVEL COSTS?",
    a9: "We only charge travel costs from 50 km onward (depending on effort). If travel costs apply, they will be shown in our non-binding quote.",
    q10: "HOW FAST WILL WE GET A REPLY / A QUOTE?",
    a10: "You’ll receive a reply or a quote within 24 hours — promised!",
