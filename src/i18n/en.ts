        p3: "It’s less about recipes or the actual preparation that we want to talk about. What has always been close to our hearts—and kept inspiring us over the years—are the stories behind those recipes. Cocktails aren’t just drinks that taste good and make you feel cheerful; they’re part of human history, adventure, and world travel. Stories about the countries they come from, the eras they originate in, sea pirates who drank them, or bartenders who invented them. All of this background is what makes cocktails, in our view, such a truly fascinating topic.",

        p1: "In the past, it was much harder to find information and background on cocktails. Old cocktail books were highly traded rarities, and searching for them in antiquarian bookshops was laborious, time-consuming, and expensive. The internet makes a vast amount of information easily and widely accessible. Wikipedia and similar sources are available to everyone and offer a wealth of knowledge. Many original sources have been digitized and provide the fascinating opportunity of a virtual journey through time. As with other topics, the art today lies in sorting this information and checking its relevance. Online, a hypothesis can quickly become a “fact” as people copy from one another and sources aren’t verified. In cocktail history we repeatedly encounter myths and bar folklore. We’ve set ourselves the goal of getting to the bottom of the origins—checking sources where possible, assessing them to the best of our knowledge, and summarizing what is known on each topic. We hope to provide interested readers with information without requiring hours of research. If we missed a source or an important detail, we welcome suggestions and feedback. Of course, every article includes full sources and links for anyone who wants to dig deeper.",

    q2: "HOW DOES THE COCKTAIL CATERING WORK AT THE EVENT?",
    a2: "We arrive before your guests, set up the bar, quickly coordinate the schedule with you, and then start service. During the event we handle preparation, restocking, and a smooth workflow — and we pack down afterwards as agreed.",
    q3: "WHAT DO YOU NEED ON SITE (SPACE, ACCESS, PARKING)?",
    a3: "Ideally a well-accessible setup area with short distances to the bar location and a loading zone/parking option for unloading. For a relaxed workflow, there should be enough space for the bar and working area (approx. 2 × 2 m per bar).",
    q4: "DO YOU NEED POWER OR WATER?",
    a4: "We need power for the bar lighting and, if required, a blender. A standard 230 V outlet is sufficient. We don’t need a fixed water connection — access to a tap is enough. We’ll coordinate details with you in advance.",
    q5: "DOES COCKTAIL CATERING WORK OUTDOORS — AND WHAT HAPPENS IF IT RAINS?",

    q6: "CAN WE ADD MORE DRINKS DURING THE EVENT?",
