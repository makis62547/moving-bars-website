      On the day of your event we deliver everything at the agreed time so that everything is ready when your guests arrive.
      Typically, we agree a number of drinks in advance that matches your guest count, and we also keep additional drinks in reserve.
      This gives you a clear cost overview upfront and the option to add more drinks during the event if you wish.
      If you prefer, we can collect everything the following day at no extra charge — so you can let the celebration end peacefully.
